        "It is the year 2084.

        When mankind ventured into space, we were curious to see if anything loomed behind those stars; unfortunately,
        we were right. The initial contacts were peaceful, but soon the people of Super Earth realized the potential
        danger of communicating with alien species, and before we knew it, they started our first intergalactic war.

        For 40 years, the war has raged on, a conflict whereby three hostile alien species are hell-bent on a single
        goal: the total annihilation of the human species. Luckily, the fighting spirit of man has not decayed since the
        last great war on Earth. We are now stronger than ever; man, woman and child alike are encouraged to try their
        strengths in the ultimate test - to have the courage to defend Super Earth." - Encyclopedia Description

    <h1>Politics of Super Earth</h1>
    <p>"Mankind has improved upon the old concept of <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">DEMOKRACY</a>. Utilizing computer aided voting software, citizens are
        asked to answer several questions, and the outcome of their vote is decided upon by the computer. This removes
        the uncertainty that existed in the old systems where voters didn't understand fully what they were voting for,
        giving us Managed DEMOKRACY." - Encyclopedia Description</p>

        giving us Managed <a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">DEMOKRACY</a>." - Encyclopedia Description</p>
        
    <p>Citizens of the federation of Super Earth use automated voting software; they answer a few questions on the
        Galactic Wide Web (GWW) and the computer votes for them based on that outcome. The GWW is a network of
        interlinked communication devices that transmit data using quantum communication, "very elementary stuff"
        according to the ship's C.O.</p>

        Political Climate
        It is made very clear at several points in the game itself and in some of its DLC's descriptions that the
        government of Super Earth has a history of brutally suppressing dissidents:

        The Super Earth broadcast screen states that: "Questions regarding the Federation or Government of Super Earth
        shall be sent to the appropriate quadrant. It is illegal to express oneself openly about the Federation or
        Government of Super Earth in a negative manner and serious cases may result in arrest or termination. Brought to
        you by Super Earth Pt Ltd. Sponsored by Super Earth."
        One of the Privates on the ship's bridge mentioned that their neighbor apparently pressed charges on their son
        for not honoring the Super Earth flag, implying that is considered a crime serious enough to warrant turning in
        one's own close family members.
        The ship's C.O. states that all communications over the Galactic Wide Web (GWW) are continuously monitored by
        Super Earth in search of "alien sympathizers".
        Citizens who doubt whether the terrorist bombings Super Earth uses as a justification to attack the Cyborgs are
        actually caused by anyone affiliated with the Cyborg Nation are decried as "Cyborg sympathizers". Those who wish
        for peace talks with the Cyborgs are painted as "hippies" and Senator John W. Killjoy threatens to have them
        jailed or even executed.
        Entire units of Helldivers, arguably among the most loyal citizens of Super Earth, have been known to be
        summarily executed for supposedly being alien sympathizers.
        The first use of the iconic Hellpods was when the socialist government of Northman's Creek tried to secede from
        the federation of Super Earth. After fifty Helldivers dropped into the Parliament, they were quickly executed
        and the planet brought into compliance. These days, Northman's Creek is the region capital of the Struve Region
        on the Bug front.
        The MP-98 Knight SMG is "often used by the Ministry of Defence to rapidly incapacitate groups of
        wrong-thinkers".
        The Defenders' signature weapon is the aptly-nicknamed CR-9 Suppressor, a semi/full auto rifle firing small
        fragmentation grenades that can devastate large masses of enemies. Their AD-334 Guard Dog drones are most
        effective against unarmored targets, firing indiscriminately at anything deemed hostile.
        The Ranger Pack DLC description mentions that "Ranger training was standard procedure for all Helldivers in the
        early years of Super Earth, but has now become rarer". From the Defender Pack DLC description, we know that
        "Helldiver Defenders used to double as riot police before humanity unified properly".
        The above means it's likely that (a portion of) early Super Earth riot police were fully-trained military
        assassination and reconnaisance specialists before Super Earth unified -- and that the Ministry of Defence also
        either acted as a police force or supplemented it.

        Fun fact: the TOX-13 Avenger was "developed by Dr. Junko under the 2079 act of self-defence research and has
        been tested extensively on live targets". The DLC description for the Hazard Ops Pack also notes the following:
        "Sometimes shunned by fellow Helldivers for their use of inhumane warfare, many a Helldiver is happy to have
        them on the mission when it comes down to life or death. It's not like the enemy is Human after all."
