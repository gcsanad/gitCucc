    <p> Super Earth - Our home.
        Prosperity, liberty and democracy - Our way of life. But it doesn't come free, it is every man, woman and
        child's duty to protect our home, our culture, and our families. Why not make the most important decision of
        your life. Make the safety of your family a personal responsibility. And prove that you have the strength and
        courage to be free. Join the HELLDIVERS! Travel the galaxy, visit the capitals, meet unusual people and
        represent the federation. Secure the resources we need to preserve our way of life and create a future for Super
        Earth. Spread managed democracy throughout the galaxy. Become more than you are. Become a Hero. Become, a
        Legend!</p>
    <p>Citizens of the federation of Super Earth use automated voting software; they answer a few questions on the
        Galactic Wide Web (GWW) and the computer votes for them based on that outcome. The GWW is a network of
        interlinked communication devices that transmit data using quantum communication, "very elementary stuff"
        according to the ship's C.O.</p>
