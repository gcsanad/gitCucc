        "It is the year 2084.

        When mankind ventured into space, we were curious to see if anything loomed behind those stars; unfortunately,
        we were right. The initial contacts were peaceful, but soon the people of Super Earth realized the potential
        danger of communicating with alien species, and before we knew it, they started our first intergalactic war.

        For 40 years, the war has raged on, a conflict whereby three hostile alien species are hell-bent on a single
        goal: the total annihilation of the human species. Luckily, the fighting spirit of man has not decayed since the
        last great war on Earth. We are now stronger than ever; man, woman and child alike are encouraged to try their
        strengths in the ultimate test - to have the courage to defend Super Earth." - Encyclopedia Description

    <h1>Politics of Super Earth</h1>
    <p>"Mankind has improved upon the old concept of DEMOKRACY. Utilizing computer aided voting software, citizens are
        asked to answer several questions, and the outcome of their vote is decided upon by the computer. This removes
        the uncertainty that existed in the old systems where voters didn't understand fully what they were voting for,
        giving us Managed DEMOKRACY." - Encyclopedia Description</p>
        
    <p>Citizens of the federation of Super Earth use automated voting software; they answer a few questions on the
        Galactic Wide Web (GWW) and the computer votes for them based on that outcome. The GWW is a network of
        interlinked communication devices that transmit data using quantum communication, "very elementary stuff"
        according to the ship's C.O.</p>
